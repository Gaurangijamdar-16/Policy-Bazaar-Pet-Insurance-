# 🐾 Policy Bazaar – Pet Insurance Module Integration

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the complete **Business Analysis documentation** for the integration of a new **Pet Insurance module** into Policy Bazaar’s existing digital platform.

The goal of this initiative is to capture untapped market potential by enabling online insurance coverage for pets — specifically **cats and dogs** — directly through the existing portal.

---

## ❗ Business Problem
Policy Bazaar currently offers insurance for individuals, families, and vehicles — but **does not provide any pet insurance**, resulting in:

- Lost market opportunities  
- Decline in customer retention for pet owners  
- Customers switching to platforms offering bundled insurance (pets + humans)  
- Missed revenue growth potential  

---

## 💡 Proposed Digital Solution
To bridge this gap, the platform will introduce a **Pet Insurance feature** that allows:

- Online insurance purchase for cats and dogs  
- Coverage across all breeds  
- Hassle-free claim process for checkups, vaccinations, and treatment  
- Seamless integration with the existing payment system  

This feature aims to boost engagement, diversify product offerings, and enhance customer satisfaction.
